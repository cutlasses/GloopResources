## GLOOP

Gloop is a performance looper for Eurorack with the ability to playback recorded loops with 4 simultaneous play heads. This is the place to find all of the digital resources for Gloop.

#Firmware

The firmware is what makes Gloop actually do anything. It's just like software on a normal computer, except it's permanent on the microcontroller until you update it. I hope to regularily update the firmware with new features and bug fixes.
